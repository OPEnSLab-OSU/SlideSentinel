## How to Setup
Install the arduino IDE, follow the adafruit [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-basic-proto/overview), and install LOOM with it dependencies with its guide [here](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/InternetOfAg/tree/master/Arduino_and_Loom_Setup)

Building the rover and base:
Refer to the schematics in the documentation for building the rover and base. All pins are labeled in the schematic located in Documentation/ProjectSpecifications. Custom printed PCB schematics are located in Integration/Hardware/Base and /Rover. Building and creating of the hardware is managed by the OPEnS lab members. A full list of materials and parts used for all phases of the project is located in the supplemental documentation in the bill of materials (BOM). The software for the hub and nodes are located in "Integration/Base" and "Integration/Rover" respectivly. Load one of the directories into arduino IDE and attach whichever device you are building them compile and export to the arduino.

The spreadsheet visualizer and parser is located at "Integration/Spreadsheet". A setup guide is included within along with some sample data.

The node application which facilitates traffic from the Rock7 servers to google spreadsheets is located at "integration/POSTproxy". A setup guide is included within. The application is active at https://postproxy.azurewebsites.net/. 

The mapping application is located at "SlideSentinelWebClient/myapp". An installation guide is included. This application hooks into the spreadsheet and pulls data to display is on a map. An active version of the map is avaliable [here](http://home.stallkamp.us:8999)

## Directory Layout
- Devices contains development, testing, and drivers for specific devices in the system.
- Documentation contains an assortment of documentation including data sheets, blog posts, notes, and the capstone documentation.
- Integration contains mostly all the up to date and in use code for the project. Some directories within are backups of previous demonstrations of the system in different iterations.
- Phase 1 Legacy Code contains some old hub code when the project was just begining.
- SlideSentinelWebClient contains the node app for the mapping application.

# Slide Sentinel Project Specification Guide

## Base

Specification | Status 
--- | --- 
Power Budget | Draws 150-160mA 
Remote Configuration | Hub can recieve remote configuration data to control the satcom upload cycle time, set verbosity scale, and force a satcom uploads.
Deployment Duration | System must last for 1 month
Range | Base unit will be elevated with reference to the node, one mile distance apart, concrete base.

## Rover

Specification | Status
--- | --- 
Power Budget | Draws ~170 mA, 4.53 mA in low power mode 
Solar Power | Solar power charger supplies ~20mA in shaded enviroments and ~175 mA in direct sunlight
Positional Accuracy | Rover must generate sub-centimeter positional calculations at least once a day, with partial tree cover (RTK fix with RTK ratio of 10)
Deployment Duration | System must last 1 month at 15 minute wake cycles
Accelerometer | Sudden orientation shifts must wake Rover unit up from sleep and trigger positional calculations.
